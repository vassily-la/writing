# Lists

## Asterisks for Unordered Lists
Use asterisks for unordered lists. Example of a grocery list:
* Milk
* Eggs
* Salmon
* Butter

## Numbers for Ordered Lists
Use numbers for ordered lists. Example of a recipe
1. Cut the cheese
2. Slice the tomatoes
3. Rub the tomatoes in flour

## Add More Formatting
Add italics, bold, or links within lists, as necessary.
* Azalea (_Ericaceae Rhododendron_)
* Chrysanthemum (_Anthemideae Chrysanthemum_)
* Dahlia (_Coreopsideae Dahlia_)

## Nested Lists
Indent each item one space more.
* Calculus
 * A professor
 * Has no hair
 * Often wears green
* Castafiore
 * An opera singer
 * Has white hair
 * Is possibly mentally unwell

## Complex Stuff
Use one empty line and one blank space for indentation. The code
Example 1:
1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.

 Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.

 If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.

 Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter.

   By "vigorous," we mean a strictly vertical motion. Julia Child once quipped:
   > Up and down and all around, that's how butter on salmon goes.
4. Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl.

   Here are some techniques on salmon-dropping:

   * Make sure no trout or children are present
   * Use both hands
   * Always have a towel nearby in case of messes

Example 2:
1. Cut the cheese

 Make sure that the cheese is cut into little triangles.

2. Slice the tomatoes

 Be careful when holding the knife.

 For more help on tomato slicing, see Thomas Jefferson's seminal essay _Tom Ate Those_.
