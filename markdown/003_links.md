# Links

Two styles of links, both rendered the exact same way.

## First Style - Inline Links
Wrap the text in brackets, then wrap the link in parens.  
[Visit GitHub!](www.github.com).  
[Search for it.](www.google.com)  

### Emphasize with bold
[You're **really, really** going to want to see this.](www.dailykitten.com)

### Make links within headings
####The Latest News from [the BBC](www.bbc.com/news)

## Second Style - Reference Links
Create an anchor in square brackets, and specify the link. Note that the anchor and the link are not shown.
To point at the anchor, provide the link in square brackets, then the anchor (also in the brackets).
Some codes here:  
Do you want to [see something fun][a fun place]?  
[a fun place]: www.zombo.com  
Well, do I have [the website for you][another fun place]!  
[another fun place]: www.stumbleupon.com
